# XeTeX-Theme4BooktypePDF
This set of XeTeX book templates is aimed at making automated Booktype PDFs easier. All variables regarding metadata, paper size, themes are saved in one seperate .tex file. The master XeTex template will read this file and change the book accordingly (e.g. build a colophon based on available metadata).
